# Deluge-Magnet-Handler
### OSX Applescript handler to open magnet URLs in Deluge.app

# Instructions
1. ) Install to "Applications" folder.
2. ) Run The application once.
3. ) Install RCDefaultApp (http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/) if you don't have it already, it's fantastical and incredibly useful anyway, and use it to associate Magnet URIs to the Magnet Handler app.
4. ) Go to a browser and click on a magnet to test it.
